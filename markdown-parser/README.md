# Markdown parser tests

This folder contains tests to validate markdown parsers.

The tests are written using [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org). To test web frontend parsers, [playwright](https://playwright.dev/python/docs/intro) is used to evaluate the markdown conversion to HTML.

> The test database is downloaded from [GitHub flavored Commonmark](https://github.com/github/cmark-gfm).
